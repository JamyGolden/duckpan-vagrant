This project provides a Vagrant-based development setup for DuckDuckGo.
(See http://duckduckhack.com for more info on that.)

This will attempt to load a VirtualBox Precise64 (http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box) machine image.  You can modify this in `Vagrantfile`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Vagrant: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html
3. Run `vagrant up`

### Usage

The box takes some time to stand up.  Once it completes, you can follow the usage instructions here: https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan#using-duckpan
