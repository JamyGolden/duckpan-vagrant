# Repos
This folder should contain the duckduckhack projects such as:
- [Goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies)
- [Spice](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice)
- [Fathead](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead)

`git clone` the projects into this folder. Once that is done, within vagrant, do the following:
```
$ cd /code/repos/zeroclickinfo-goodies # or whichever project you've cloned
$ duckpan server
```
